# The Covid Tracker 
CIS550 group project - The Covid Tracker, by Jiayu Zhu, Jiaqi Lu, Anlan Chen and Steve Wang 

Our web application aims at providing guidance for people to understand COVID itself and how it has changed people’s lives within the United States in various aspects, especially before and after the lockdown(stay at home) order. We presented case counts by state with demographic breakdown. Further, we collected and displayed the following data as indicators to understand the change of people’s daily lives: time outside home, online education participation, employment rate, consumer spendings, job postings etc. We hope by summarizing these information, we can better understand the impact of COVID-19, and provide insights for policy makers in case of future pandemics.
